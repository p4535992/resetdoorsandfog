Reset Doors and Fog - Remastered

Adds a button to the Walls Menu to Shut all doors in the current scene. Also adds a menu to the context dropdown for the Scene Navigation and Scene Directory menus to shut all doors and delete fog in the selected scene to prepare it for a fresh visit from characters. I find it useful after QAing a new map for holes in walls/doors and checking lighting, etc.

*REMASTERED*

Remastered changes the functionality from closing ALL doors to closing ONLY opened doors.
Doors that are currently locked remain locked, and are not closed.
